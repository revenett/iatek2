If you author open source Bootstrap templates or themes you can submit your works for inclusion on BootstrapZero. Template should meet this criteria:

- free, open source
- no use of LESS or custom Bootstrap builds
- 100% responsive for multiple device widths

While a database is in the works, here is how you can submit your project(s)..

- Construct a JSON object for each template/theme you want to submit. Here is an example:

    ```
    {
        name:"Darkside",
        title:"Darkside",
        short:"Dark with off-canvas sidebar",
        full:"The deep gray layout features a sidebar drawer menu that responsively collapses off-canvas on smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones.<br>When the sidebar is collapsed, it can be toggled on so that it slides in from the left and consumes 40% of the screen width.<br>This template also includes a sticky bottom footer that stays at the bottom regardless of content height.",
        tags:["theme","fixed","dark","collapse","off-canvas"],
        imgUrl:"http://www.bootply.com/assets/templates/88105.png",
